Question: 11
Currently, your engineering department is organized in siloed teams that specialize by function (e.g. front-end, back-end, database and testing). What would you consider when moving away from component teams towards feature teams? (Choose the best answer) : 
   You cannot begin Scrum without having feature teams. It is easier to measure and compare performance between feature teams. Feature teams should have an equal number of team members.
   Members within feature teams require compatible personalities. Feature teams should have a mix of junior and senior members. Tasks are completed more quickly than component teams.
   Moving from component teams to feature teams could reduce productivity in the initial stages. Feature teams have less communication complexity. Getting support from the business side makes the transition easier.

Kleopatra is a new Developer in a Scrum Team, who completed a task that met the Definition of Done during her first week in the company. When the Increment was released by the Product Owner, it caused a problem in the client's domain. What is true? (Choose all that apply) : 
   The Developers are not doing enough testing to cover everything that they should.
   As Kleopatra is a new Developer, Developers should wait until she gets some experience, and then her work could be part of the Increment
   If all the Developers agree, then incomplete work can be released as part of the Increment.
   The Developers don't have a good enough Definition of Done, they should review it.
   An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal.
   The Definition of Done promotes transparency by ensuring that everyone is aware of the work that was completed as part of the Increment.


Question: 20

   False
   True


Question: 23
Ali works as a Scrum Master for an organization that has hired 30 Developers. He's working on ways to make team formation go more smoothly. What type of team structure is best for creating integrated increments? (Choose the best answer) : 
   It doesn't have to be a specific one, it depends on the product that they are delivering. They might not have to be cross-functional to deliver.
   Every Scrum team is cross-functional, which means the Developers have the right mix of skills required to deliver end to end value without external dependencies.
   Each team specializes in one technical layer of the system (e.g. front-end, database, back-end etc.).


Question: 24
Peter is a new Product Owner on a newly formed Scrum team. Peter has projected a product completion date based on an estimated velocity of 21 completed points per Sprint. After the first 3 Sprints, the Developers have determined that their maximum velocity is 15 points and that they are unable to create shippable Increments at the end of each Sprint. What is the best way to proceed? (Choose the best answer) : 
   Extend the Sprint in order to complete the Sprint Backlog items.
   The Scrum Master would coach the team on improving their estimations and commitment to completing the Sprint Backlog.
   Due to the failure of the Sprints to produce shippable Increments, opportunities to inspect and adapt have been lost. To increase the team's capacity, the Scrum Master should encourage the organization to add more team members.
   Inform Peter that the projected completion date is not correct. The Developers would estimate the remaining work to produce a shippable Increment and suggest completing it (make it meet the Definition of Done). Based on empirical data, Peter can adjust the completion date and decide how to continue.


Question: 25
Two new Developers have started working for a Scrum team. They are unsure how much work needs to be done before an item can be considered complete. How much effort does a Product Backlog item that the Developers select for a Sprint require?  (Choose the best answer) : 
   An equal amount of time on analysis, design, programming, testing and documentation.
   As much as they can fit into the Sprint. Any remaining work will be moved to a subsequent Sprint.
   As much as they have informed the Product Owner will be done for every Product Backlog item they select following the Definition of Done.

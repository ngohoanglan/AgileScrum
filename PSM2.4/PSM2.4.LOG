Question: 3
Steven is employed as a Scrum Master by the engineering department. The Director of Engineering considers using Scrum for a new project but wonders about the value of having all of the Developers attend the Daily Scrum. He is concerned that employees are already required to attend numerous company meetings. What are two outcomes of the Daily Scrum that Steven should explain on why the Daily Scrum is important? (Choose the best two answers) : 
   The Daily Scrum serves for the Developers to report to Steven, as a Scrum Master, all updates on the assigned tasks in the Sprint Backlog. He can then use the teamâ€™s updates to plan their work for the next day, making sure that every team member is assigned the right tasks.
   During the Daily Scrum, the Developers needs to update the Scrum board with their current status and progress, at a task level. This is crucial to ensure that the Directory of Engineering knows the teamâ€™s actual progress and control the work being done.
   The Developers will produce a daily status report indicating how much time was spent working on individual tasks since the last Daily Scrum. The reports will help in discussing how the Sprint went at the Sprint Review meeting. It will provide detailed insights into the accuracy of estimates versus actual time spent, which can be used to create better estimates at the next Sprint Planning.
   During the Daily Scrum, the Developers will inform of problems that are hindering their progress, and for which they have no means to resolve. They will inform Steven as a Scrum Master, so he can cause the removal of the impediments and help the team be more productive.
   Through the short, daily alignment of the Daily Scrum the Developers grow and improve a shared understanding of the most important work to be undertaken in the next 24 hours to achieve the best possible progress toward the Sprint Goal. This daily opportunity to inspect and adapt will enable the Developers to best tackle any unforeseen circumstances that might otherwise disrupt the teamâ€™s progress.

   Start facilitating more productive and useful Retrospectives, in order to teach them the importance.
   Suggest reducing the frequency of the Retrospectives.


Question: 6

   At the end of Sprint Planning, collect all Sprint tasks and create a consolidated plan for the entire Sprint.
   Visit the five Scrum teams daily to ensure alignment and that all Sprint Backlogs remain synchronized.
   Teach the Product Owner to collaborate with the technical leads to order the Product Backlog in such a way that there is no technical or development overlap during a Sprint.
   Advise the teams to minimize dependencies by working on separate development branches and integrating at the end of four Sprint cycles.
   Teach them that it is their responsibility to form the teams such that each team will have the necessary skills, knowledge, and competencies to create an integrated Increment by the end of every Sprint.


Question: 7
If multiple Scrum teams are working on the same product, all Scrum teams must mutually define a Definition of Ready (DoR).

Question: 9
Your organization's&nbsp;director of engineering emphasizes the importance of meeting deadlines in order for the engineering department to be seen as a reliable source&nbsp;for the product management department. The director has calculated that the team's velocity needs to increase by 15% in order to meet the product's release date commitment he made to management. He requests that Steven, the team's Scrum Master, should&nbsp;increase the velocity of his team. Which of the two options would be the best for Steven? (Choose the best two answers) : 
   He tells the director that this is not his responsibility in Scrum. He tells the director to work with the Product Owner to check whether the estimates on the Product Backlog are being respected during implementation.
   He educates his director on how it is part of a teamâ€™s self-management to improve velocity. He invites the director to the next Sprint Retrospective to brainstorm on how they can improve.
   He explains how a team uses a Sprint's velocity to forecast work for the next Sprint rather than to predict future productivity perfectly. He prompts the director to the Product Owner for all information on the development process.
   He helps the director understand that it typically takes a few Sprints for a team to gradually increase the velocity up to the level expected. Meanwhile he presents this to the team as a challenge and a company goal, leaving it however up to them to figure out exactly how to achieve this.
   He informs the director of any organizational impediments to the team's productivity that he is aware of. He suggests collaborating with him on how to remove these impediments.

Question: 14
Steven is Scrum Master and leads three Scrum teams that are all working on the same product and using the same Product Backlog. Management wants to standardize how velocity is calculated across all three teams in order to identify which teams are high performing and which teams need more support. What would be the best two responses Steven could provide to management? (Choose the best two answers) : 
   The amount of business functionality that a Scrum team creates in a Sprint is known as velocity. It's specific to that team and is used to inform Sprint Planning.
   There is no direct relationship between velocity and value.
   It's a good idea to standardize velocity across teams to see which ones are producing the most value.
   Providing incentives based on velocity can increase the Scrum teamâ€™s motivation to produce more value.


Question: 15
During the Sprint Review, one of the stakeholders announces that due to recent market changes, there is a risk that funding might be reduced for the project. This triggers tensions to rising and arguments to break out between members. As a Scrum Master, what would be the best actions to take? (Choose the best two answers) :

   True
   False


Question: 17
During a Product Backlog refinement meeting, the Product Owner introduces a business objective that will be worked on for the next Sprints. To achieve the business goal, the Product Owner sees a set of critical features that must be supplied. Because the features will be using sensitive user data, they will be subjected to external security audits.  These non-functional security requirements were not applicable to previous Increments. What are two effective methods for developers to address these high-security concerns? (Choose the best two answers) : 
   During the Sprint Retrospective, the Developers assess how to add these expectations to their Definition of Done so every future Increment will meet these security requirements. If needed, they can work with external specialists to better understand the requirements.
   To avoid disrupting Developers during feature development, they should be planned in parallel Sprints. After security concerns have been resolved, they will be applied to previously completed work before new features can be developed.
   They are added to the Product Backlog and addressed throughout the next Sprints, combined with creating the business functionality in those Sprints, no matter how small the business functionality.
   A complete list of security-related Product Backlog items needs to be created before starting a new Sprint.
   They should be handled by a separate security team in a parallel Sprint so that security issues can be resolved through application enhancements without affecting functional development.


Question: 18

   There should be five Product Owners, one for each Scrum team.
   The product has one Product Backlog and one Product Owner.


Question: 19
Your organization requires all Increments to pass user acceptance testing (UAT) before it is allowed to be released to production. Is it a good idea to postpone UAT until the end of the project to prevent the Developers from being disrupted during the Sprints? (Choose the best answer) : 
   Yes, because UAT is done in a hardening Sprint before the release Sprint.
   Yes, because the Scrum team is a self-managing team and should not be disrupted during development.
   It depends on the teamâ€™s Definition of Done.
   No, because the state of the Product Increment wonâ€™t be transparent and the communications won't be good enough.


Question: 20
Select two ways in which Scrum uses timeboxing to promote self-management? (Choose the best two answers) :

   By keeping the Scrum board and burn-down chart updated daily.
   By helping the Developers with user acceptance tests and tracking defects.
   By ensuring each member takes turns speaking at the Daily Scrum and ending the event on time.


Question: 23

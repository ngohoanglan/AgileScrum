What should Steven do in this situation? (Choose the best answer) :

Question: 8
Steve is a Scrum Master asked to assist in creating five new Scrum teams that will be working to build a highly anticipated product.

The product is very important to both the end-users and the organization. Of the choices raised by future team members, what would Steven encourage? (Choose the best answer) : 
   Wait until enough of the infrastructure and architecture is in place before starting the first Sprints. This will increase the success of delivering integrated Increments in Sprint 1.
   Each Scrum team delivers functionality at the end of each Sprint. New Product Backlog items will then be added to the next Sprint Backlog to integrate their functionality with the other teams to create a unified Increment.
   Each Scrum team delivers Increments in its own code branch. After UAT is performed at the Sprint Review, the code branch is isolated until enough Increments are considered acceptable. All code branches will then be merged during the release phase.
   All Scrum teams agree on a mutual understanding of â€˜doneâ€™ that defines all work necessary to deliver a potentially shippable Increment that includes all previous Increments delivered for the product.

   There is no acceptable reason. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.
   Thereâ€™s not enough work in the Product Backlog to work on in the upcoming Sprint.

Question: 13
Three Scrum teams are currently building a single product and pulling work from the same Product Backlog. All three teams have identified that they will need Kareem, a database specialist, to work full time in their team for the next several Sprints. What should Steven, the Scrum Master, do to solve this potential problem? (Choose the best answer) : 
   Manage the items in the Sprint Backlogs so that Kareem can be utilized evenly for each team.
   Assign Kareem to the team with the most urgent tasks first and then move him to the next team and so on until the required support is completed.

Question: 18
An organization has just hired you as a new Scrum Master to help them transform their teams from their current traditional process to Scrum. The teams are currently structured to specialize in a single function, which is also known as component teams where a team would only address a single layer (i.e. front-end, back-end, testing, etc.). You've introduced the concept of cross-functional teams where all the skills needed to produce business functionality, from end to end, are inside of a single team. What should you keep in mind when transitioning from siloed teams to cross-functional teams? (Choose the best two answers) : 
   It is easier to compare the performance between cross-functional teams in order to decide which teams to assign tasks to and which teams need additional coaching.
   Without featured teams, you cannot do a Scrum. Postpone Scrum adoption until the teams are reorganized in featured teams.
   Newly formed teams will need time to stabilize before reaching their peak performance. During the initial stages of forming, performance will suffer and productivity may be low. However, there are still chances that the delivery of business value will increase. 
   People from different layers and components will need time to become accustomed to working and delivering unified functionality together as one Scrum team thus productivity may suffer.

The team is arguing that synchronizing each day is too difficult and has suggested that the Daily Scrum should&nbsp;be held every other day instead. What three main issues would arise if the Daily Scrum was held less frequently? (Choose the best three answers) : 
   Impediments would be raised and resolved slower.
   Less information regarding progress would be shared as this would cause the Sprint plan to become inaccurate and reduce transparency over progress toward the Sprint Goal.
   The Product Owner would not accurately inspect the utilization of the individual team members.

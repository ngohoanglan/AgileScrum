   Steven shares his concerns with Chris and the impact on the other team members and that he should be a team player.
   Steven suggests helping them in self-management, and if requested, Steve could facilitate a session with the entire team to assist in the resolution of the problem.
   Steven tells the concerned members that Chrisâ€™ opinions should be respected as he has the most experience and understands what is best for long term sustainability.
   Steven observes whether this topic is raised at the Sprint Retrospective. If not, he then checks with the team on how comfortable they are with the way the design and architecture are being handled.
   Steven takes the time between Sprints to organize a team building session to build a stronger relationship.


Question: 4
In Scrum, how would budgeting and financial forecasting be performed? (Choose the best two answers) : 
   Frequently inspect the outcomes of the delivered Sprint Increments to understand how much value is being produced per investment spent.
   A single release can be funded by a series of Sprints, each of which produces shippable Increments.
   Budgeting is unnecessary because the only funding required is for the Scrum teams' operational costs.

   False
   True


Question: 7
During the implementation of a Sprint Backlog item, there is a disagreement among team members about what work is required to make the item 'done.' Some argue that it is included in the Definition of Done, while others argue that it is not. Steven, the Scrum Master, notices a debate forming and members taking sides. What is the best course of action for Steven? (Choose the best answer) : 
   Bring in the Product Owner and have him or her decide how much work is needed to get the item to meet the Definition of Done.  It is the Product Ownerâ€™s responsibility to manage the Developers.
   Immediately end the discussion before it becomes worse. Make the decision on what work is needed to make the item â€˜doneâ€™ and teach the team about the importance of avoiding conflicts.
   Bring the Developers together and interpret the Definition of Done for them so that there are no future conflicts on interpretation.
   Coach all members on the Scrum team to self-manage and help them resolve the conflict, refine the Definition of Done, and become effective again. Tell the team that conflicts are a natural occurrence and coach them on the value of resolving conflicts.


Question: 8

Question: 22
Paul is a Product Owner for multiple products. Each product is allocated a dedicated Scrum team and a set budget. Based on the average velocity of a previous product release, Paul had estimated a new product to take 10 Sprints to complete. The average velocity of the previous product release was 45 completed units of work per Sprint. Over the first 3 Sprints, the Developers reported an average velocity of 40 completed units per Sprint, while not fully completing the required integration tests. The Developers estimate that integration testing would require additional effort to make the Increments shippable and they are unsure if the required velocity is achievable. What is the most effective way to recover? (Choose the best answer) : 
   The Scrum Master sets the open work aside to be performed in one or more release Sprints. They remind Paul that he needs to find funding for enough Release Sprints to complete the remaining work. It's possible that one release Sprint is required for every three development Sprints. Paul is responsible for informing users and stakeholders about the implications of the release date.
   The Scrum Master will manage the Sprint Backlog and assign work to the Developers to ensure that each one is used to its full potential. â€‹The Scrum Master will keep track of any unused resources so that the budget is not impacted. Unused budget can be allocated for additional Sprints if needed
   In the next Sprints, the Developers strive to make the selected work as close to the Definition of Done as possible and at the minimum 90% completed. Any undone work is divided into new Product Backlog Items that will be deferred to the last Sprint in order to maintain stable velocity.
   The Developers inform Paul that the progress he has perceived to date is not correct. The Increment is not releasable. They give Paul their estimate of the effort it would take to get the previous work â€˜doneâ€™, and suggest doing that work first before proceeding with new features. The team also re-estimates the effort to make the remaining Product Backlog items â€˜doneâ€™, including all integration efforts. In the end, it is Paulâ€™s call to continue the project or to cancel.

   Talk to the Developer privately and tell him that he needs to be a team player.
   Ask the Scrum team, what value will result from having all team members present at the Daily Scrum and what are the risks if members don't attend.
